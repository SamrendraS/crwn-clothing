What could've been done better:
    1. Underestimated scale of state, began with using only React state
    2. Might choose to use simpler state management such as mobx
    3. Styling is time consuming and not straightforward, use library such as material ui
    4. Explore MongoDB as a NoSQL option, learn more about SpringBoot
